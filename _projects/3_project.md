This project presents a complete black box vulnerability assessment conducted on a virtual machine, simulating a real-world offensive security audit. The audit was performed using Kali Linux and a range of industry-standard tools, including Metasploit, Nmap, Gobuster, Nessus, and others.

The findings were compiled into a professional audit report using PwnDoc, which ensures a structured format with key sections such as execution timeline, executive summary, vulnerability overview, and detailed technical analysis. The report covers several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities, including:

CVE-2023-26048 (Jetty DDoS vulnerability)

CVE-2024-23897 (Arbitrary file read in Jenkins)

CVE-2024-40725 (Source code disclosure)

Privilege escalation via GNU Screen 4.5.0

Weak/default credentials and web-based injection attempts

Each vulnerability is documented with exploitation steps, screenshots, and analysis. The project also includes a step-by-step manual outlining the audit methodology and the use of each tool throughout the process.

Designed for both educational and professional development purposes, this project demonstrates how to conduct and document a complete security audit following industry standards.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
